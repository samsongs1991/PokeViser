## 🕹️ About
While playing Pokemon GO 📱 I got sick of searching for pokemon weaknesses one by one. Thus came my inspiration for PokeViser.

In PokeViser, a single-page web app, users can search through 898 Pokemon and select six at a time to learn about. Users can easily search using the search bar and apply filters to hone in on the Pokemon they are looking for.

Once a selection is made users can view sprite images 👾, base stats 📈, info text ✏️, typings 🍃🔥💧, damage relations 🏹, and relative heights 📐 of their selected Pokemon. For a surprise Pokemon parade click on the "About" page 🎊.!
